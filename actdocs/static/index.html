<p>
If you would like to come then please <a href="[% make_uri('login') %]"
>log in</a> and <a href="[% make_uri('register') %]"
>register</a>, if you have
attended an Act event recently you will probably already have
a login otherwise you will need to create a new user first.
You can do this by using the links in the navigation menu to the left of this text.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to speak then please <a href="[% make_uri('newtalk') %]"
>submit your talk here</a> as soon as possible - the earlier you submit,
the more likely your talk is to be accepted.
</p>

<h2>Is There a Theme?</h2>
<p>No, there is no theme so please submit talks about anything you have been working on or think people will find interesting. Your talk does not even have to be related to Perl.</p>
<p>We welcome the submission of talks, discussions, presentations and workshops using other languages, or that have separate technical or engineering objectives. The strength in developing is knowledge from a wide variety of sources. If you use another programming language or system to connect physical and virtual devices together and want to submit or attend the event then we would be honoured to welcome you. If you are connected to a UK Hackspace and wish to attend and display then please approach the organisers with ideas of your requirements.</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>If you would like to sponsor the London Perl Workshop then please do not heistate to contact the organisers and they will help you with your proposal.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>Speakers are invited to talk on any subject. We will accept talks from people of any age, background or circumstance, the London Perl Workshop is an inclusive event and we would love to have you attend.</p>

<p>This year we hope to have access to three Workshop rooms and would like to run as many workshops as possible. We would also love to refresh the skills of those wishing to engage with the latest developments in the Perl and other languages. If you wish to submit a workshop please use the same submission form as the talks, please note that workshops will be 60, 120 or 240 minutes in length.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Proposal Deadline:</strong> Friday 27th October 2017<br />
